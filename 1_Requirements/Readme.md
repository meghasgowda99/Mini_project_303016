# Requirements
## Introduction
 This project is implemented using the c programming language.The main goal is to convert the given input in one of the number system to another desired number system.
 

## Research

 For digital hardware, the natural numbering system is binary (base 2),but expressing anything in binary causes way too many bits to be used. So, it's not practical.
 Hexadecimal allows us to use 4x fewer bits, so, it is very useful.Besides no processor uses anything less than 4bits, so, hexadecimal is the most common when expressing numbers in a way that is most suitable for digital hardware.
